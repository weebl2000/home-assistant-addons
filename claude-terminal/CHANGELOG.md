# Changelog

## 2.3.0

### ✨ New Features
- **Keep Claude Code on the latest version across restarts**: The CLI is now updated to the latest published version on every add-on startup, instead of being pinned to whatever was bundled in the image at build time. Previously, rebooting Home Assistant reverted Claude Code to the bundled version.
  - New `auto_update_claude` configuration option (enabled by default)
  - The update is non-fatal: if the network is unavailable at startup, the add-on falls back to the bundled version and continues

### 🛠️ Configuration
Disable the per-startup update (and stay on the bundled version) with:
```yaml
auto_update_claude: false
```

## 2.2.2

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed ha-mcp installation on Python 3.12** (#79): Added `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` to uvx invocations to resolve package resolution failures when the HA wheels index lacks compatible wheels for the current Python version
  - Contributed by [@tt2g89](https://github.com/tt2g89)

### 🛠️ CI/CD
- Added automated build and smoke test workflow for pull requests
  - Dockerfile linting via hadolint
  - Container builds verified for amd64 and aarch64
  - Smoke tests for script executability and required binaries
  - Required status checks prevent merging broken PRs

## 2.2.1

### 🛠️ Configuration
- Disable remote access port 7681 by default

### 🔒 Security Note
The default configuration enabled unauthenticated access on the local network. For users who have not customized the port setting, direct access on port 7681 is now disabled by default. Access through Home Assistant (ingress) is not affected by this change. Users who need direct port access can re-enable it in the add-on configuration.

## 2.2.0

### ✨ New Features
- **Bundled Home Assistant MCP Server** (#48): Claude Code now has native Home Assistant integration
  - Switched to [homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp) - the comprehensive HA MCP server
  - 97+ tools for entity control, automations, scripts, dashboards, history, and more
  - Automatic configuration using Supervisor API - no manual token setup required
  - Natural language control: "Turn off the living room lights", "Create an automation for sunset"
  - New `enable_ha_mcp` configuration option (enabled by default)
  - Contributed by [@brianegge](https://github.com/brianegge)

### 🛠️ Configuration
Enable or disable the Home Assistant MCP integration in your add-on config:
```yaml
enable_ha_mcp: true  # default
```

### 📦 Technical Details
- Uses `uvx ha-mcp@3.5.1` for automatic package management and Python version handling
- Installed [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) via Alpine package for fast Python package execution
- MCP server connects to Home Assistant via internal Supervisor API (`http://supervisor/core`)
- Authentication uses the add-on's Supervisor token automatically

### 🔒 Security Note
The ha-mcp integration gives Claude extensive control over your Home Assistant instance, including the ability to control devices, modify automations, and access history data. You can disable it at any time by setting `enable_ha_mcp: false`.

### 💬 Example Usage
Once configured, you can ask Claude things like:
- "What's the current state of my thermostat?"
- "Turn on the porch lights"
- "Create an automation that turns on the coffee maker at 7 AM"
- "Show me the energy usage for the last week"
- "Debug why my motion sensor automation isn't working"

## 2.1.0

  - Terracotta (#d97757) accent color for cursor and UI highlights
  - Improved contrast and readability with 14px font size
  - Matching tmux pane borders and window status colors

### 🎨 Visual Improvements
- Redesigned welcome banner with terracotta-accented borders and breathing room
- Redesigned session picker banner with matching branded style
- Dynamic version padding prevents box-drawing misalignment
- Cohesive color language across terminal theme, tmux, and banners

## 2.0.0

  - Claude Code loads this automatically — no configuration needed
  - Run `ha-context` to refresh, `ha-context --full` for detailed entity listings
  - New `ha_smart_context` config option (default: true) to enable/disable
  - Queries Supervisor + Core APIs: entities by domain, error log, system health
- **Welcome Screen**: Polished first-launch experience with version tracking
  - Styled banner displayed on every terminal open
  - "What's New" highlights shown once per version upgrade
  - Version tracking persisted across restarts

### 🎯 User Experience
- Every Claude session now has context about your HA environment out of the box
- Ask Claude about your entities, automations, or errors — it already knows

### 💙 Thank You
To everyone who stuck with me through the v1.6–1.9 rough patch — the musl binary issues, the nested tmux errors, the auth helper breakage — thank you for your patience, your bug reports, and your trust. This release is dedicated to you. I heard every issue, and I'm committed to making Claude Terminal the best it can be.

## 1.9.0

### 🔄 Changed
- **Reverted to npm installation**: Switched back from native installer to `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
  - Native binary requires musl 1.2.6+ (`posix_getdents` symbol), which Alpine 3.21 does not ship
  - npm installation runs on Node.js, avoiding all musl binary compatibility issues
  - Resolves #57, #60, #61
- **Removed native binary symlink logic** from `run.sh` (no longer needed with npm install)

## 1.7.0

### ✨ New Features
- **Session Persistence with tmux** (#46): Claude sessions now survive browser navigation
  - Sessions persist when navigating away from the terminal in Home Assistant
  - New "Reconnect to existing session" option in session picker (option 0)
  - Seamless session resumption - conversations continue exactly where you left off
  - tmux integration provides robust session management
  - Contributed by [@petterl](https://github.com/petterl)

### 🛠️ Technical Details
- Added tmux package to container
- Custom tmux configuration optimized for web terminals:
  - Mouse mode intelligently disabled when using ttyd (prevents conflicts)
  - OSC 52 clipboard support for copy/paste to browser
  - 50,000 line history buffer for extensive scrollback
  - Vi-style keybindings in copy mode
  - Visual improvements with better status bar
- Session picker enhanced with reconnection logic
- Automatic session cleanup and management

### 🎯 User Experience
- No more lost work when switching between Home Assistant pages
- Browser refresh no longer interrupts Claude conversations
- Tab switching preserves full session state including history
- Improved reliability for long-running Claude sessions

## 1.6.1

### 🐛 Bug Fix - Native Install Path Mismatch
- **Fixed "installMethod is native, but directory does not exist" error**: Claude binary now available at `$HOME/.local/bin/claude` at runtime
  - **Root cause**: Native installer places Claude at `/root/.local/bin/claude` during Docker build, but at runtime `HOME=/data/home`, so Claude's self-check looks in `/data/home/.local/bin/claude` which didn't exist
  - **Solution**: Symlink created from `/data/home/.local/bin/claude` → `/root/.local/bin/claude` on startup
  - **Result**: Claude native binary resolves correctly regardless of HOME directory change
  - Ref: [ESJavadex/claude-code-ha#3](https://github.com/ESJavadex/claude-code-ha/issues/3)

## 1.6.0 - 2026-01-26

### 🔄 Changed
- **Native Claude Code Installation**: Switched from npm package to official native installer
  - Uses `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` instead of `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
  - Native binary provides automatic background updates from Anthropic
  - Faster startup (no Node.js interpreter overhead)
  - Claude binary symlinked to `/usr/local/bin/claude` for easy access
- **Simplified execution**: All scripts now call `claude` directly instead of `node $(which claude)`
- **Cleaner Dockerfile**: Removed npm retry/timeout configuration (no longer needed)

### 📦 Notes
- Node.js and npm remain available as development tools
- Existing authentication and configuration files are unaffected

## 1.5.0

### ✨ New Features
- **Persistent Package Management** (#32): Install APK and pip packages that survive container restarts

  - Packages installed via command or config are automatically reinstalled on startup
  - Supports both Home Assistant add-on config and local state file
  - Inspired by community contribution from [@ESJavadex](https://github.com/ESJavadex)

### 📦 Usage Examples
```bash
# Install APK packages persistently
persist-install apk vim htop
